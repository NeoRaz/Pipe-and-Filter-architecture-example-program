A system that implements pipe and filter architecture to decompose a task that performs complex processing into a series of separate elements that can be reused.

# Pipe and Filter

Pipe and Filter is an architectural pattern that comprises self-contained entities known as filters that change the data inputted. It's a simple but effective architecture that's also extremely long-lasting. It consists of a variety of components (filters) that modify or filter data before handing it on to other components via connectors (pipes). At the same time, all of the filters are active. It's commonly used to depict a simple sequence, but it can also represent a very complex structure. The pipe-and-filter design is defined by the sequential manipulation of data streams.
